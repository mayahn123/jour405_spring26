title: "Sampling"
---

Follow along with the demo to learn how to sample data from a population using R and the Tidyverse. You should get started by loading the tidyverse in a new R block.

### Task 1: Load the tidyverse
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


### Task 2: Load 1,000 rows of data with the ages of people from 18-80
```{r}
set.seed(42)
population <- tibble(
  age = sample(18:80,1000,replace = TRUE)
)
population 
```


### Task 3: Sample 100 rows of data from the dataset
```{r}
sampled_data <- population |>
  summarise(
    mean_age = mean(age), 
    sd_age = sd(age)
  )
sampled_data
```


### Task 4: Calculate the mean age and standard deviation of the sample
```{r}

sample_stats <- sampled_data |>
  summarise(
    mean_age = mean(age),
    sd_age   = sd(age)
  )

sample_stats
```


### Task 5: Calculate the mean age and standard deviation of the population
```{r}
population_stats <- population |>
  summarise(
    mean_age = mean(age),
    sd_age   = sd(age)
  )

population_stats
```


### Task 6: Compare the sample and population statistics

Compare the means and standard deviations. Are they similar? Go back and re-run the sampling and statistics calculations with a smaller sample size. How do the results change?

The mean age and standard deviation for the population and sample group are about the same. The mean age is very slightly higher in the population and the standard deviation is slightly lower. When I charged the sample size to 20, the standard deviation was larger than the 100 person sample and the population. The mean age was also closer to the population average age. 

```{r}
population_stats <- population |>
  summarise(
    mean_age = mean(age),
    sd_age   = sd(age)
  )

population_stats
```
